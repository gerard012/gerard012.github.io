  <h2>3d Animated Avatar</h2>

  <p class="description"> The story behind each character is that the oversize human has control over everyone; the astronaut, control is usually needed to be able to stay on track when on a mission and for guidance, and for the robot it needs to depend on a human to be able to function properly and stay functional. The landscape is also under the control of the human’s influence because it’s being overpowered by its size and the human can make changes to the land if it wants too; but at the same time all three of them have some control over the oversize being because without them there is no power or control being expressed or existing.</p>
